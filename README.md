# loveGuide

I've always been interested in how people can find love, and I wanted to create a fun little project to help people figure out if they're ready to be in a relationship. I started thinking about what factors might make someone ready for love, and I realized that age is a big one - some people are more mature and ready for a serious relationship at a younger age, while others might need more time to grow and figure themselves out.

So I decided to create LoveGuide, a small JavaScript project that gives users advice based on their age. I worked on the project in my spare time over the course of a few days, learning more about JavaScript as I went. I had to figure out how to get the user's age and then use that to give them customized advice, which was a bit tricky but also really rewarding when I got it working.

In the end, I was really happy with how LoveGuide turned out - it's a fun little project that I hope will bring a smile to people's faces and maybe even help them figure out if they're ready for love. And who knows, maybe it will even help some people find their boo-boo!"

Enjoy!❤❤❤
